## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant gold (#FFD700), echoing the university's colors, provides energy and elegance.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), close in hue to gold but highly desaturated, offers a clean and readable foundation.
- Accent color: A muted, dark orange (#CC6633), analogous to the gold, creates contrast and draws attention to key interactive elements. 
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use custom icons for different faculties and course types. Math courses might have calculator icons, arts courses could use a quill, and so on.
- Employ a card-based system to display courses, requirements, and schedules. Grid layouts ensure content alignment and intuitiveness, leveraging whitespace for clarity.
- Incorporate micro-interactions like hover effects, animated transitions, and a confetti burst upon fulfilling a requirement to enhance engagement and provide feedback.
